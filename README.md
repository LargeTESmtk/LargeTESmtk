# Modelica LargeTESmtk Library

Welcome to the development site of the Modelica *LargeTESmtk* (LargeTESModelingToolkit) library.

## About

The *LargeTESmtk* is a Modelica-based toolkit for the modeling and simulation of large-scale pit (PTES) and tank (TTES) thermal energy storage systems. In addition to an easy-to-use Modelica library with pre-built storage models, the toolkit's features should provide the foundation for developing new storage models customized to the wanted application.

## Application

Possible applications of the library models are in simulations studies...
- ...to address relevant storage design questions (e.g., regarding volume, geometry, or insulation)
- ...to investigate long-term effects (e.g., the development of the storage performance and ground temperatures over the operation period)
- ...to evaluate the storage interaction in different system integration concepts (e.g., with solar thermal plants, heat pumps, or combined heat and power plants)
- ...

## Model Verification and Validation

The two main PTES and TTES models have been thoroughly tested in several model verification and validation studies (see [Related Publications](#related-publications)).

## Development Status

Current status:

- The library is available in a first basic version, including the TTES model(s) and the corresponding main submodels, which can be used as building blocks for new storage models.

Upcoming: 

- The PTES model(s) exist in an initial version and have already been subjected to model verification and validation studies 
(see [Related Publications](#related-publications)). We are currently in the process of preparing
these models for publication (e.g., refining their structure and improving their usability).
- Enhance model documentation
- Add further example models demonstrating the application of the library

## Tool Support

The library was developed and tested in *Dymola* (up to version 2025x Refresh 1). Testing in *OpenModelica* is planned for the future.

If you have used/tested the library with any other Modelica-based simulation tool, please let us know.

## License

The Modelica *LargeTESmtk* library is available under the Mozilla Public License (MPL 2.0).
See [LICENSE](https://github.com/LargeTESmtk/LargeTESmtk/blob/main/LICENSE) file.

## Dependencies

This library uses models from the Modelica [IBPSA](https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa) library, version 4.0.0 (development status).

**Note:**  
Commit [`e6de2f3`](https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa/commit/e6de2f3eb075d20452092441f78ee36adfaf5824) (date: 2025-02-16) is the latest version tested with this project. Other versions may not be fully compatible.

You can obtain the correct library version in two ways:

- **Manual download:** [Download the source at this commit](https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa/tree/e6de2f3eb075d20452092441f78ee36adfaf5824).
- **Recommended (submodule):** After cloning this repository, run:
  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
  This will download the library into `ExternalLibraries/IBPSA`.

The Modelica *IBPSA* library is licensed under a 3-clause BSD-license. See [Modelica IBPSA library license](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa/blob/master/IBPSA/legal.html).
